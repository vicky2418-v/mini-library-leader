Description
This project is a web-based Mini Library Management System built with Flask (Python) for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend.<br>

It allows users to manage a small library, including adding books and users, borrowing and returning books, tracking transactions, and more.<br>

The system features a modern, responsive design and supports book cover images and user authentication.<br><br>

How It Works <br>
The application starts with a login page. Users can log in by entering their name.<br><br>

Once logged in, users can:<br>

  - Add new users to the system<br>

  - Add new books (with optional cover images)<br>

  - Search and filter books by title, author, or availability<br>

  - Borrow available books and return borrowed books<br>

  - View a list of all users and books<br>

  - See a list of all transactions (borrow/return history)<br>

  - View which books each user has currently borrowed<br><br>

All actions are reflected in real-time thanks to dynamic updates and AJAX calls.<br>

Book availability is automatically tracked, and users are prevented from borrowing books that are already checked out.<br>

Success and error notifications are shown for all major actions.<br>

The application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.<br><br><br>
